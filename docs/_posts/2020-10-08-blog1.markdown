This week we continued to work on developing the database by adding 5 new tables

| Table | Description |
|----|----|----|
| project_model |  Links projects to models is n to n | 
| port |  Ports are comments of models | 
| model_port |  Links ports to models is n to n | 
| file | Any file a project consists of  | 
| project_file |  Links files to a project is n to n  | 




After meeting with Bruno and discussing the format of the new tables added we decided on a few changes.

1. Each project should have one model, which can be a coupled model containing more models until each model is atomic. This mean rather than having n to n relation between project and model. A project has 1 to 1 relation with the root of a hierarchy tree of models.
1. Models should be able to have a relationship with files as well. 
1. Ports are related to only one model; therefore, the relationship should be changed to one model can have multiple ports, but each port can only belong to one model. (1 -n)
1. 	Each file should be related to a person so in the future if a file needs to be re-examined the correct person or people can be contacted.
