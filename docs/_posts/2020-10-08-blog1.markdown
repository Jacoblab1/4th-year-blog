This week we continued to work on developing the database by adding 5 new tables
<div align = "left">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Table</strong</td><td> <strong> Description </strong> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>project_model</td><td> Links projects to models is n to n</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>port</td><td> Ports are comments of models</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>model_port</td><td> Links ports to models is n to n</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>file</td><td> ny file a project consists of </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>project_file</td><td> Links files to a project is n to n </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
<div>



After meeting with Bruno and discussing the format of the new tables added we decided on a few changes.

1. Each project should have one model, which can be a coupled model containing more models until each model is atomic. This mean rather than having n to n relation between project and model. A project has 1 to 1 relation with the root of a hierarchy tree of models.
1. Models should be able to have a relationship with files as well. 
1. Ports are related to only one model; therefore, the relationship should be changed to one model can have multiple ports, but each port can only belong to one model. (1 -n)
1. 	Each file should be related to a person so in the future if a file needs to be re-examined the correct person or people can be contacted.

Changes recommended from meeting with Bruno have not been implemented yet.
