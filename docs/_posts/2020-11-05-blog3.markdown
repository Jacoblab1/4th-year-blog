**November 5th Blog 3**

This week we continued to work on developing the database. We implemented the recommended changes suggested by Bruno in Blog 1. <br>
A relationship between files and models was added, Ports now only relate with one model and Files now have an author.



After meeting with Bruno and discussing the changes made to the database, we concluded that Files is a very large scope and needs to be divided into sub-entities. In the future, we are going to specialize the files table.


Current Layout of our database:

Changes recommended from meeting with Bruno have not been implemented yet.

# Setting up Heroku

We also spent some time working to configure the arslab-services project to be deployed with Heroku.

Currently, the Java web application is running successfully after we writing some configuration files to ensure that it and all of it's dependencies were built correctly.

The modules to build the project were configured like so:

{% highlight xml %}
   <modules>
      <module>sim.services</module>
      <module>sim.parsing</module>
      <module>sim.rise.ext</module>
   </modules>
{% endhighlight %}

Then, we created a Procfile to tell Heroku what command should be used to run the server.

{% highlight bash %}
  web: java $JAVA_OPTS -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar --port $PORT sim.services/target/sim.services.war
{% endhighlight %}

The Heroku project has also been configured to automatically deploy from Github, so whenever we make changes to our repository it will automatically build the new version of our code.

Our next steps with Heroku will be to deploy our new database schema onto a Postgres DB and connect it with the web server that we have running.
