This blog will serve as a place for us to share weekly updates while we work on our 4th year project.

Our team has four members:
* Jon Menard
* Chang Qiu
* Paul Roode
* Jacob Laboissonniere

We're currently working on designing a new database schema that will be able to store more data about models after a simulation has run.

This blog is a static [Jekyll][jekyll-docs] site running on GitHub Pages. Jekyll has built in support for code-snippets, so we'll even be able to share snippets of the code we're working on.

Here's an example of the built-in code-snippet support:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
