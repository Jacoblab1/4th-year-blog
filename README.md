# 4th Year Project Blog

This is a static blog for our 4th year project.

Posts can be created by creating a new markdown file in the `docs/_posts` directory.

View the live version of the blog [here](https://jacoblab1.github.io/project-blog/)

note***

To insert images you can't use a relative link, you must use the server link

example - docs/_posts/images/databaseOctober20 can not be used, **it must be https://github.com/Jacoblab1/project-blog/blob/master/docs/_posts/images/databaseOctober20.jpeg?raw=true**
